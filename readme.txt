step 01) :- create superuser(manager)
step 02) :- we use JWT in this project to login and logout purpose.
step 03) :- now go to the 'gettoken' link to get the token after superuser credentials are right.
we get two tokens one is access token ,another is refreshtoken.once access token expire then refreshtoken given another token to access our profile,we can control time also what time access time expire ,but in this project we use defaults.
step 04) :- you can use this superuser to access our api 'Employee' you can perform there CRUD operations.
step 05):- you can test on "swagger/" as well our api's.
thankyou.
